# 📚 Advanced Python Generators Project

## 📝 About the Project

This project explores advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently process and interact with large datasets. Through a series of realistic, data-driven tasks, you will simulate live updates, perform memory-efficient computations, and optimize batch data operations. The project leverages Python's `yield` keyword and integrates SQL for real-world data handling.
